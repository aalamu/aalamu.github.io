I'm a software engineer experienced in both backend and frontend development.
I primarily work with Java, TypeScript, Python, Spring Boot, Node.js, Angular, and React.Js.

I'm also passionate about Cloud Computing and DevOps, building and deploying cloud-native applications using AWS and GCP.
I enjoy exploring how AI can enhance software development and user experience.

I enjoy creating scalable, maintainable solutions and continuously learning new technologies that improve developer productivity and user experience.

## Projects

### [Detective Z](https://github.com/aalamu/detective-z)

Detective Z is a web app that allows users to investigate a link or product to determine whether it may be associated with scams, fraud, phishing, or other types of malicious activity. 
It provides an easy way to verify suspicious online content and protect users from potential harm.  

The app leverages generative AI and real-time data from Google, X, Meta, Reddit, YouTube 
to provide users with contextual insights, helping them make safer and more informed decisions online.

### [Localizer](https://github.com/aalamu/localizer)

Localizer simplifies adding multi‚Äëlanguage support to Java applications, allowing them to serve users in their preferred locale effortlessly.
It resolves localized messages via `Localizer` instances or beans, covering general, response, and error messages. Out of the box, it integrates with Spring and can be extended to frameworks like Vaadin, Quarkus, and Jakarta.

**Java** \| **Maven**

### [20-20-rule](https://github.com/aalamu/20-20-rule)

20-20-rule is a React.js app that helps you take better care of your eyes.  
It tracks how long you‚Äôve been staring at your screen and reminds you to take breaks, following the 20-20-20 rule. It‚Äôs all about reducing eye strain and building healthier screen-time habits.
I vibe-coded it with Grok.
